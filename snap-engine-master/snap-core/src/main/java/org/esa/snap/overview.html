<p>This is the overview page of the BEAM Java API and examples documentation.

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The BEAM (Meris and (A)ATSR ToolBoX) Java library comprises a development framework
and a great number of packages containing specific, problem-oriented implementations.

<h2>The BEAM Framework API</h2>

<p>The BEAM Framework API is a core part of the BEAM API which defines all interfaces,
classes and recurring design patterns used to implement concrete software modules such
as the processing tools, data product readers and writers or map projections.

<p>This package provides the software frameworks used throughout the MERIS/(A)ATSR Toolbox
software.

<p>Currently, the following framework packages exist:
<ul>
    <li> {@link org.esa.snap.core.datamodel} - Product in-memory resentation - <i>the most important BEAM package</i></li>
    <li> {@link org.esa.snap.core.dataio} - Product Data I/O plug-in framework</li>
    <!-- TODO: following link does not work, cause ther is no class defined within this package-->
    <li> {@link org.esa.snap.core.dataop} - Product data manipulation interfaces and design patterns</li>
    <li> {@link org.esa.snap.core.processor} Product processing framework, used by all scientific data processors</li>
    <li> {@link org.esa.snap.core.param} - Generalized parameter handling</li>
    <li> {@link org.esa.snap.core.ui} - User interface (UI) related classes and sub-packages</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that all classes and packages contained in  <code>org.esa.snap.framework</code> are independent
from other <code>org.esa.snap.*</code> classes and packages.


<h2>The <code>{@link org.esa.snap.util}</code> Package</h2>

This package provides several utility classes and sub-packages used throughout
the MERIS/(A)ATSR Toolbox software.

<p>
Currently the following sub-packages exist:
<ul>
    <li> {@link org.esa.snap.util.io} - I/O-Utilities</li>
    <li> {@link org.esa.snap.util.jai} - Support classes for JAI (Java Advanced Imaging API)</li>
    <li> {@link org.esa.snap.util.math} - Mathematical helper classes</li>
    <li> {@link org.esa.snap.util.logging} - Logging capabilities</li>
</ul>

<h2>The BEAM API Source Code Examples</h2>

Provided here is a short documentation for the Java source code examples provided along with
the BEAM Software. It shows the basic concepts on how to use the BEAM Java API
for your own applications:

<p>1. {@link org.esa.snap.examples.data_export}: very simple examples showing how to read data from a product
and write them out: The package conatins three source files:
<ul>
<!-- @todo 1 nf/se - check correct paths! -->
 <li><a href="{@docRoot}/org/esa/snap/examples/data_export/BandWriterMain.java.txt">BandWriterMain.java</a></li>
 <li><a href="{@docRoot}/org/esa/snap/examples/data_export/BitmaskWriterMain.java.txt">BitmaskWriterMain.java</a></li>
 <li><a href="{@docRoot}/org/esa/snap/examples/data_export/TiePointGridWriterMain.java.txt">TiePointGridWriterMain.java</a></li>
</ul>

<p>2. {@link org.esa.snap.examples.ndvi_simple}: a very simple NDVI (normalized differential vegetation index)
processor. The package contains a single source file:
<ul>
 <li><a href="{@docRoot}/org/esa/snap/examples/ndvi_simple/NdviSimpleMain.java.txt">NdviSimpleMain.java</a>
</ul>

<p>3. A more advanced NDVI processor which uses parts of the BEAM processing framework can be found on the
<a href="http://www.brockmann-consult.de/beam/plugins.html">BEAM plug-in page</a>.
<p>In order to compile the examples, the ZIP file also contains a <code>build.xml</code> file for use
with the open source tool <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/ant/"><code>ant</code></a>
(a kind of <code>make</code> for Java) developed by the <a href="http://www.apache.org">Apache Software Foundation</a>.
</p>

<p>Newcomers who want to develop export tools and data processors are invited to look at
{@link org.esa.snap.examples.data_export} and {@link org.esa.snap.examples.ndvi_simple} first.
The first package contains basic tools which lets you extract geophysical data from
products. The {@link org.esa.snap.examples.ndvi_simple} package contains a few lines of code showing you how to
compute the NDVI value from a MERIS Level 1b input product.
</p>

<p>Once you have understood that, please examine the {@link org.esa.snap.examples.ndvi_processor} example
contained in this package. {@link org.esa.snap.examples.ndvi_processor.NdviProcessorMain} implements is a
fully functional data processor which uses some important concepts and mechanisms of the BEAM
processing framework. Don't be afraid, it is still very easy code. It can be used as a template
for your own data processors.
</p>

<p>This is the list of the most important API packages used by the examples:
<ol>
   <li>The <code>{@link org.esa.snap.core.datamodel}</code> package.</li>
   <li>The <code>{@link org.esa.snap.core.dataio}</code> package.</li>
   <li>The <code>{@link org.esa.snap.util}</code> package.</li>
</ol>
